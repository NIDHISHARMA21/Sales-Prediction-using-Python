# Sales Prediction Using Python
### Project Overview
###### This project involves forecasting future sales based on advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to analyze and interpret data to make informed decisions about advertising strategies, ultimately helping businesses optimize their sales potential.

### Key Components

#### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
###### Load dataset and handle missing values.
###### Check for and remove duplicates.
###### Apply feature scaling and outlier treatment.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
###### Generate pairplots and correlation heatmaps to understand data relationships.
###### Visualize distributions and relationships using various plots.

#### 3. Model Training and Evaluation:
###### Implement Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.
###### Evaluate models using performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

#### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
###### Use GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model’s hyperparameters.

#### 5. Deployment:
###### Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to deploy the model and showcase predictions.
